## VERY LARGE DISCLAIMER from iateyourpie

> **"This is not meant for everyone. This is as of now, not an "official" ironmon ruleset. I tried way too hard to make a ruleset that the community wanted with Survival, and that entire process was stressful. I am going about this the same way I went with the original Kaizo. I'm making something I want to make and if others enjoy it so be it.**
> 
> **I'm not really looking for feedback, I'm not really looking to make this more accessible. I'm looking to make an even more challenging version of Kaizo. If you read the rules and say "that sounds like fun" cool! If you read it and say "wow this is awful" cool! I'm just out here trying to find new ways to play my favorite pokemon game!"**
